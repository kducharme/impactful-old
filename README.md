# Impactful
Impactful makes launching, managing, and growing programs simple and effective for any non-profit, no matter their mission. Currently, fragmented and outdated software are forcing non-profit employees to spend at least 30% of their time, worth on average $13,000 per employee per year, doing things that could be automated or avoided all together. Impactful seeks to solve this.

## Core features:
1. **Effective program management** - ensuring that programs are setup and managed in a way that contributes ot the core mission of the organization
1. **On-site project management** - whether you have one site or 200, Impactful makes planning and implementing a breeze
1. **Digital asset management** - easily share digital assets across the organization with built-in asset management system
1. **Task tracking** - assign, set dates, and track tasks associated with projects and programs
1. **Mobile management** - manage programs and projects on the go and easily take pictures, upload, and share with your staff while on-site
